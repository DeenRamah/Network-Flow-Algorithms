# Ford-Fulkerson Method
Is a greedy approach that computes the maximum flow in a flow network by repeatedly finding augmenting paths and increasing the flow
# Edmonds-Karp algorithm
An algorithm that implments of ford-fulkerson that uses Breadth-first-search to find the shortest augumenting path
# Dinics Algorithm
Improves on the Ford-Fulkerson method combining BFS and DFS, it builds a level graph using BFS and then sends fow using DFS finding flows
